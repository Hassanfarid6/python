#Expression Execution

#1 String and numeric value can operate togather
#a, b = 4, 2  ;txt = "@"

#print(a*txt*b)

#2 string and can operate with + When two string add is called concatenation

#A, B = '4', 5

#tet = '$'

# print((A+tet)*B)

#3 Numeric value can operate with all arithmetic operators

#  A, B = 4, 2 ;C = 4
#  print(A*B+ C)

#4 Arithmetic expression with integer and float will result in float

"""A, B = 4.5, 3 
print(A*B)

#5 Result of division operator with two integers will be float

A, B = 4.5, 3  ;C = A/B
print(C)
"""
#6  Integer division with float and int will give int displayed as float


A, B = 1.5, 3 ; C = A//B

print(C, A/B)
